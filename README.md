Once the user clicks on the link above, they will be presented with a daily work planner to create a schedule with the current day and date at the top.  The planner will include the hours between 8am to 6pm, typical working hours. During those hours, the user will be able to enter events/projects in the text area and save the input to their local storage, so that if the user exits the planner or refreshes the page, the user will not lose any information saved.  The user will also experience color coded time blocks to indicate which event is past due, current, or upcoming.

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule

WHEN I open the planner 
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event

WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
